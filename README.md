This is the AutoHotKey (.ahk) I use for my office PC. It's not going to have any use for other users right now, but in time I would like to add features that allow other people to adapt the code to suit their work styles.

## Installation
This program and all it's files expect to be in C:\AHK and unless you go in and change this within the code... that's the way it is for now.

## License
There isn't one. Use my code how ever you wish. Just mention me if you do use the code.
